    Wari for Psion 3a version P1.00

    Copyright (c) 1997 Nick Matthews, KizzyCo

Wari is a game of strategy for two players, or one player and a
computer. It comes from a group games of called Mancala which
originated in West Africa. It is reported to be over 3000 years
old and was originally played in holes scooped out of the ground
and seeds or shells for counters. It is on my "ToDo" list to find
out more about other versions of Mancala and maybe add them as
options to the game. The rules I have used here are those given in
an ancient copy of the "Zorland Games Toolkit". Full details of how
to play and the rules are provided by the online help.

The Wari move generator comes from the same "Zorland" source,
with only a few modifications by me. The rest of program has been
put together after long hours spent studying the SIBO 'C' SDK.
It was intended as quick project to aid understanding of the inner
workings of the Psion and their development tools. It has served that
purpose well, apart from the quick bit, and I felt that it deserved
a wider audience.

Any comments, good or bad, should be addressed to me (Nick Matthews),
preferably by email. I am always pleased to hear from anyone using my
software.
